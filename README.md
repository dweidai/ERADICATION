Game Background:
In the year 2020, a detrimental disease named X1N1 starts to spread in X-town. So far, according to the local news report, 
everyone in X-town has been affected. Scientists claim that the disease is spreading through skin-to-skin contact and 
people who caught X1N1 will become irrational and their muscles start to develop uncontrollably. X1N1 affected ones will 
end up behaving like a zombie hulk. These zombie hulks will become overly attached to the healthy human skin and will do 
anything possible to get others affected. The affected ones then will die within a week without any cure. Because there 
is no cure and it’s overly risky to have X1N1 affected people coming to the lab to do an experiment, the government thinks
that it’s best to eradicate the whole X-town. Luckily, you were picked by the government to do the job. Your goal is to 
control the bombs that are dropped over X-town to destroy as many buildings as you can. Hopefully, before all the bombs 
are released, you can successfully burn the whole town into ashes. You do not want anyone who caught X1N1 to be alive.
